<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Overview</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The study of magic on <a href="index.html#MissingReference">Talmiar</a> is conducted at the mage's colleges, which are spread out across the continent. While each school of magic is represented at one of the colleges, some of the colleges house the study of more than one school. 
</p>

<p>
Twice a year, The Intercollegiate Conference is held at the Sovereign City to discuss new progress in the study of magic.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> The College of Abjuration and Illusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Located in Owlbreak, the College of Abjuration and Illusion primarily concerns itself with the research of magical security measures. While the College of Abjuration and the College of Illusion were formerly separate, they joined together when the Colleges realized that they were doing the same work from opposite angles. The College of Illusion was researching the subversion of security, and the College of Abjuration was interested in improving security. One Spring, it was announced at the Intercollegiate Conference that the two colleges would be merging into one at the Abjuration College's campus in Owlbreak.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> The College of Evocation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Located in Bridgescar, the College of Evocation has spent the recent years researching methods for amplifying spells that were recorded in a particular research manuscript of unknown authorship.
</p>

<p>
The manuscript posits that if two casters &#x2013; while completely in sync &#x2013; were to cast the exact same spell at the exact same time expending the same level of spell slot, then the spell might somehow be amplified. This technique came to be referred to as "simul-casting"
</p>

<p>
In an effort to reproduce this result, the College has taken to training mages in pairs. When one is enrolled in the Evocation college, they are immediately paired up with another student. A pair lives together, eats together, and studies together in an effort to keep them in sync. As such, most (if not all) students of the Evocation College would have this individual as a "bond".
</p>

<p>
These endeavors eventually bore fruit, when a pair of 2nd-year students managed to simul-cast a 3rd-level fireball which had a 40ft radius. Due to the residual damage, it is suspected that the inner 20ft of the sphere might have been more powerful than usual, but there is no conformation of this. In response to this success, the College has redoubled it's efforts, but very little progress has been made.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> The Diviner's College</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
The Diviner's College (which is located in The Sovereign City) is a school which studies the history of Talmiar and it's gods. While divination spells are a subject of research by the college, they are more primarily a tool with which to glean knowledge about the past. As such, the library at the Diviner's College is considered to be the most expansive in the region. In order to maintain and grow it's collection, The Diviner's College is the number one employer of scribes on the continent.
</p>

<p>
The Diviner's College is also the venue for the Intercollegiate Conference, which many academics consider to be the highlight of the year if for no other reasons than to peruse the College's library and to experience the schools famous hospitality.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> The School of Magic Craftsmanship</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
The Blazesong School of Magic Craftsmanship is the home to the Colleges of Transmutation and Enchantment. While a fair number come to study at the school to attend these Colleges, the majority of those who enroll do so to learn the art of artificing. Many of Talmiar's artificers first studied at this school, which was founded by Dwarven and Elven immigrants who were dissatisfied with the lack of a place to conduct their research.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-5"><span class="section-number-3">2.5</span> The College of Life and Death</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
The Drycourt College of Life and Death was re-branded from the College of Necromancy in an effort to improve the schools image. The school was often the subject of protests, and those who did not know better often assumed that the school was inhabited by those who sought Lichdom.
</p>

<p>
In truth, the college has always been a center for medicinal research. Many of the schools research projects leverage necromantic effects as a reproducible and controllable way to test their hypotheses, and researchers always take the utmost precaution to ensure the safety of their test subjects.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-6"><span class="section-number-3">2.6</span> The Idolatry of the Boundary Saintess</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
The Idolatry of the Boundary Saintess is the name taken by the College of Conjuration located in Augaset. Despite this, however, they are closer to a <a href="relig.html#MissingReference">minor religion</a>. Members of the Idolatry worship a mysterious figure known as the Boundary Saintess, who is said to be the greatest conjurer (and perhaps the greatest mage) to ever live. Much of the research conducted by the Idolatry is centered around reproducing magics that are contained in the stories recorded about the Saintess, which has lead to many great advancements.
</p>

<p>
For example: the spell teleportation circle was first discovered by the Idolatry, attempting to recreate the peculiar way in which people would supposedly visit the Saintess.
</p>

<p>
Most people outside of the Idolatry believe that the records of the Saintess are actually a collection of ancient children's stories which were misinterpreted as a historical account due to the story's  fantastical 'Happily ever after' endings and episodic structure.
